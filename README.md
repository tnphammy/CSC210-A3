## Reflection

What do you see as the benefits and downsides of working with linked lists instead of arrays? When might they be most useful versus limiting?
- They are more memory efficient. However, if you're working with indexes, it will be very difficult.



What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?
- Nesting code logic and throwing execpetions appropriately


What do you feel you learned from this assignment?
- I learned better coding practices and how to use the Java Debugger in VSCode!
